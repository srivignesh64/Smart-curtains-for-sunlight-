Smart Curtains System – Procedure File

1. Objective

To design and implement a smart curtain system that automates the opening and closing of curtains based on environmental factors such as sunlight intensity and time, using sensors and a microcontroller.


---

2. Components Required

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno / NodeMCU)

Light Sensor (LDR)

Real-Time Clock (RTC) module (e.g., DS3231)

Servo Motor or DC Motor with Driver (L298N)

Relay Module (if using AC curtains)

Power Supply (5V/12V)

Wi-Fi Module (if IoT enabled, e.g., ESP8266)

Jumper Wires, Breadboard

Curtains with a motorized track (optional)

3. System Architecture

1. Sensor Input:

LDR senses ambient light.

RTC provides current time.



2. Microcontroller Logic:

Processes sensor/time data.

Determines curtain position (open/close).



3. Motor Control:

Motor/relay activates curtain movement.



4. (Optional) IoT Layer:

Sends data to mobile app/cloud.

Enables manual override via mobile.

4. Procedure

Step 1: Circuit Design

Connect the LDR to analog input of the microcontroller.

Connect the RTC module via I2C (SDA, SCL).

Connect the motor/relay to a digital pin via driver module.

Ensure power supply is stable for all components.


Step 2: Programming the Microcontroller

Write code to:

Read light levels from the LDR.

Get current time from RTC.

Decide curtain position based on:

High light = close curtain (if it’s hot)

Low light or night time = open curtain (for natural air/light)


Activate motor accordingly.



Step 3: Testing

Upload code via Arduino IDE.

Simulate morning/evening light conditions.

Check curtain movement for correct logic.


Step 4: Integration with IoT (Optional)

Use NodeMCU or ESP8266.

Create a web interface or use Blynk/ThingSpeak for manual control.

Send sensor data to the cloud.

6. Safety Precautions

Ensure all wiring is insulated.

Use appropriate resistors for LDR.

If using 230V AC curtain motors, handle with caution and use relays with isolation.
